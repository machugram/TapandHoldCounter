# TapandHoldCounter.  
Project Two Of The 40 Projects Of Swift

An iOS app that increases in count when the user taps or holds on the button. 
This helped me understand the difference between gesture recognizers and touch events.
Using the tapGestureRecognizer and LongPressGestureRecognizer, the count increment speed  varies.
