# TapandHoldCounter.  
Project Two Of The 40 Projects Of Swift

This project is a tap and hold and counter that starts from one and increases upwards.
This helped me understand the difference between gesture recognizers and touch events.
Using the tapGestureRecognizer and LongPressGestureRecognizer, the number increment speed  varies.
